Complete cross-browser console.log()

Many front-end web developers make use of the wonderful browser consoles that have matured in the
past few years. While the tried-and-true console.log() often does the trick, its lack of support
(particularly in IE) has led to the use of proxy functions, such as Paul Irish’s console.log
wrapper and Ben Alman’s Debug() which prevent unsupportive browsers from throwing errors.

I had a need for logging data in every browser, not just ones that natively support console.log().
So I forked Paul’s function and expanded it to work with every browser I could test
— IE6-9, Firefox 3.6 & 4+, Chrome 10+, Safari 5+, and Opera 11+.
